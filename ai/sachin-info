WORK EXPERIENCE - NOKIA BELL LABS, MACHINE LEARNING INTERN IN SUMMER 2025
At Nokia Bell Labs (Nokia's AI divison), Sachin built a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain and Pinecone embeddings. This system leverages historical errors and solutions from JIRA to generate context-aware plans of action for solving new issues. The system was successfully adopted by over 8 teams. He enhanced the system with LangGraph-based AI agents that connected to dashboards, identified failing virtual machines, and autonomously executed recovery actions (primarily Linux commands), automatically resolving over 60% of daily issues. The system reduced manual troubleshooting time by 85% and improved system reliability by 40%. Furthermore, Sachin also contributed to ML research as follows: Sachin analyzed industry research papers on Generative AI's impact on 5G traffic and leveraged Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to visualize trends. His analysis revealed a strong cross-correlation (r = 0.72) between AI demand and 5G network load. He developed an RNN-based predictive model achieving 4.4% MAPE using TensorFlow to forecast AI-driven 5G network traffic, enabling Nokia to make data-driven decisions that led to significant increases in infrastructure investment.

PROJECT - PLANET HABITABILITY PREDICTOR
Sachin created a comprehensive Planet Habitability Predictor using TensorFlow, Kaggle datasets, Pandas, NumPy, NASA Exoplanet data, and Python. He obtained and cleaned NASA Exoplanet data (removing invalid and NaN rows) and scaled it for machine learning models. He designed algorithms for determining habitability based on proximity to Earth's metrics and developed an Artificial Neural Network prediction model with TensorFlow to predict habitability scores. The project includes case studies analyzing NASA's top 5 planet colonization candidates and achieved 89% accuracy in predicting potentially habitable planets.

PROJECT - HACKATHON WIN - HACKTHE6IX
Sachin won HackThe6ix, competing against 400 participants in the FinTech and DEI category sponsored by Fidelity Investments. He created StockSee to visually depict correlations between real-world events and stock prices, making the stock market understandable for everyone. The platform proves that stock prices aren't random but are affected by real-world events and news. He designed JavaScript algorithms for identifying and highlighting significant stock price fluctuations, created an LSTM model (65% validation accuracy) using TensorFlow that uses historical price data and article sentiment scores, and developed a custom NLP sentiment analysis model (68% accuracy) trained on Kaggle datasets. The platform helped users make more informed investment decisions and demonstrated the power of combining financial data with news sentiment analysis.
