# Portfolio Chat Frontend

A modern portfolio by Sachin, featuring a 3D Avatar, AI Persona/Chatbot, and Portfolio Overview

## About

Backend/AI
- RAG Chatbot: Hugging Face model for embeddings of provided information/text, vector store in a Pinecone DB instance
- Using Langchain with the Google Gemini LLM to create/orchestrate the AI RAG system and natural AI persona conversation
- Multi-modal support for text, bold titles, links, images, files, etc...
- Deployed as a Flask app using Koyeb

Frontend
- NextJS with React (TSX version)
- Deployed with Vercel at sachinvedgupta.com
- ThreeJS for an avatar of me
- Using Plotly to visualize the embeddings in a lower dimension (reduced to 2D via PCA)
- Clean and simple UI
- AI chatbot module
- Portfolio viewing section with experience, leadership, projects, etc


## Highlights

- **Features**: AI RAG chatbot, 3D avatar, modern responsive design  
- **Technologies**: Next.js (TypeScript), React, Flask, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, Google Gemini LLM, Pinecone, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Three.js, Plotly, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Vercel, Koyeb, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, REST APIs, cloud deployment, UI/UX design  
- Designed and developed a modern personal portfolio website integrating a 3D avatar and interactive AI persona for dynamic user engagement  
- Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Hugging Face embeddings, Pinecone vector database, and LangChain orchestration with Google Gemini LLM  
- Added multi-modal compatibility, allowing the chatbot to dynamically output text, bold titles, links, images, and files directly in the interface  
- Implemented vector visualization using Plotly with PCA dimensionality reduction to display embeddings in 2D  
- Developed the frontend in Next.js (TypeScript) with a clean, responsive UI, deploying seamlessly to Vercel  
- Created a custom Three.js 3D avatar for interactive presentation of personal brand  
- Engineered and deployed the Flask backend to Koyeb for scalable AI inference and data retrieval

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- Your Flask backend running on `http://localhost:5000`

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start your Flask backend first:**

   ```bash
   cd ai
   python rag.py
   ```

3. **Start the frontend development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Test everything is working:**

   ```bash
   python test_frontend.py
   ```

## Backend Requirements

Make sure your Flask backend is running with the following endpoints:

- `POST /ask` - Accepts `{"question": "your question"}` and returns `{"status": "success", "answer": "response"}`
- `POST /reset_db` - Resets the database (optional)

## Usage

1. Start your Flask backend first:

   ```bash
   cd ai
   python rag.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

4. **Chat and Visualize**:

   - Type questions in the chat interface
   - Watch the vector space visualization update in real-time
   - See your question vector (red star) and similar vectors (orange circles)
   - Observe the search area circle around your question
   - **Interactive 3D visualization** with mouse controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
   - Compare 2D and 3D representations side by side

5. Try questions like:
   - "What are your skills?"
   - "Tell me about your experience"
   - "What projects have you worked on?"

## Customization

- **Colors**: Modify the Tailwind classes in the components
- **Styling**: Edit `app/globals.css` for custom styles
- **API Endpoint**: Change the fetch URL in `ChatInterface.tsx` if your backend runs on a different port

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14** - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **React Hooks** - State management

## Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
